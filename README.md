## News Match Popup Plugin

We recommend that News Match program participants using WordPress use the [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker) plugin. It's free, easily extended, compatible with many common newsletter and donation techniques, and comes with a built-in theme editor so you can configure popups to appear how you want them to.
