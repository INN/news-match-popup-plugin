This plugin integrates with the free [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/) plugin to create a default popup with preconfigured, recommended settings based upon the Institute for Nonprofit News' research as part of the [Knight Foundation's News Match](https://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/announcing-news-match-2017-2-million-fund-will-match-donations-to-nonprofit-newsrooms) program. While the News Match program is limited in membership, this plugin can be used by anyone. All it does is create a default popup easily.
